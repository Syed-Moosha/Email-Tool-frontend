# Project Title: Email Tool

# Project Summary:

- This project is aimed at developing a full-stack application for sending bulk emails using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application will allow users to sign-up, sign-in, create customizable email templates, manage recipient lists i.e mail can be send to one or more recipients by using semicolon example:test@gmail.com;test1@gmail.com, and track the performance of sent emails. User authentication access control will ensure security and controlled access.

# Tech Stack:

- Frontend: React.js (for building the UI), Formik (for form validation), tailwind, flowbite (for responsiveness).
- Backend: Node.js and Express.js (for RESTful APIs).
- Database: MongoDB (for user, email, and recipient data).
- Authentication & Security: Firebase, JWT (for token-based authentication), Bcrypt (for password hashing).
- Email Service: Mangodb storage.
- State Management: Redux and Context API (for managing state across the app).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
